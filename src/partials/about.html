	<h3>Hi.</h3>
	<div class="about__image" style="background-image: url(../../assets/me.png)"></div>
	<p>
		I'm Eric Amodio &mdash; an entrepreneur, innovator, leader, architect, and full-stack developer. My passion lies
		with dreaming up new ideas and bringing them to life through code. I thrive on challenges and solving complex
		problems, while also ensuring that the challenges accepted and solutions devised are always made with an eye on
		the bigger picture &mdash; the user experience. I pride myself with the ability of being able to see the forest
		for the trees, as well as being able to dive deeply into the details. I take great care in the experience,
		architecture, and code of the products that I build.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also an open-source enthusiast and
		<a title="See me on GitHub" href="https://github.com/eamodio" target="_blank">maintainer</a>. I &#x2764;
		open-source &mdash; both building and contributing. I love the collaboration and the sharing of knowledge driven
		by the open-source movement. It is a wonderful and exciting time to be a developer.

		When I'm not coding <sup> <a title="Yes, that can happen occasionally">1</a> </sup> or keeping up with the
		latest technologies, you will find me spending time with my wife and two kids. I also love traveling, hiking,
		camping, and diving.
