		I'm Eric Amodio &mdash; an entrepreneur, innovator, leader, architect, and full-stack developer. I am currently
		the CTO at <a href="https://gitkraken.com" target="_blank">GitKraken</a>. My passion lies with dreaming up new
		ideas and bringing them to life through code. I thrive on challenges and solving complex problems, while also
		ensuring that the challenges accepted and solutions devised are always made with an eye on the bigger picture
		&mdash; the user experience. I pride myself with the ability of being able to see the forest for the trees, as
		well as being able to dive deeply into the details. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code
		of the products that I build.

		My favorite editor is
		<a title="Learn more about Visual Studio Code" href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"

	<p>
		I am also an open-source enthusiast and
		<a title="See me on GitHub" href="https://github.com/eamodio" target="_blank">maintainer</a>. I &#x2764;
		open-source &mdash; both building and contributing. I love the collaboration and the sharing of knowledge driven
		by the open-source movement. It is a wonderful and exciting time to be a developer.
