	<h3 class="subhead mt-1">Hi.</h3>
	<p>
		I'm an open-source enthusiast and
		<a title="See me on GitHub" href="https://github.com/eamodio" target="_blank">maintainer</a>. I &#x2764;
		open-source &mdash; both building and contributing. I love the collaboration and the sharing of knowledge driven
		by the open-source movement.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the same time, open-source comes with a cost, which gets paid by trading time and energy from other areas
		&mdash; for me it's usually sleep &#x1f4a4;, but sometimes also family. Of course, by sponsoring me and my work,
		you can't create time, but you can certainly help increase the desire and reward for trading this precious time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I spend a lot of my &ldquo;free&rdquo; time building, maintaining, and supporting
		<a title="Learn more about GitLens" href="https://gitlens.amod.io/" target="_blank">GitLens for VS Code</a>
		and have for well over 4 years now. From its very humble beginnings, GitLens has grown wildly beyond my
		expectations &mdash; in both its reach as well as its demands on my time and attention. GitLens now has over 6
		million installs (~40M downloads &#x1F631;) and is used by teams of all sizes, from single developers to large
		enterprise teams. I also author, maintain, and support many other VS Code extensions (and have ideas for many
		more) as well as contribute to many open-source projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		So if you find
		<a title="Learn more about GitLens" href="https://gitlens.amod.io/" target="_blank">GitLens</a> or any of my
		contributions useful, please consider sponsoring me. Additionally please follow me on
		<a title="Follow me on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/eamodio" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
		and
		<a title="Follow me on GitHub" href="https://github.com/eamodio" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, or consider
